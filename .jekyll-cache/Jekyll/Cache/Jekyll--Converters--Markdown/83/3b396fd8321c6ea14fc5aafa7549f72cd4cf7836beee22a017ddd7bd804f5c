<p>Machines as we know, are good at computation. In terms of computation, there are 3 elements involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Input</li>
  <li>Function</li>
  <li>Output</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, computation applies a <strong>given function</strong> on <strong>given input</strong>, and return some kind of <strong>output</strong>. However in Machine Learning, <strong>Input and Output are given</strong>, and the job of the machine is to figure out the <strong>Function</strong> which describes the relationship between them, also known as <strong>model</strong>, or <strong><em>h</em></strong> for <strong><em>hypothesis</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="are-all-machine-learning-the-same">Are all Machine Learning the same?</h2>

<p>NO. There are mainly 2 types of Machine Learning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supervised-learning</li>
  <li>Unsupervised-learning</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-on-supervised-learning">More on supervised-learning</h3>
<p>In supervised-learning, input and output are provided. The job is to figure out the relationship between them.
Supervised-learning can be futher categorized into Regression problem and Classification problem.</p>

<h4 id="regression">Regression</h4>
<p>When the output is a continous number. Eg:</p>

<ul>
  <li>predicting price of the house</li>
  <li>predicting a personâ€™s income by certain age</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="classification">Classification</h4>
<p>when the output is discrete, we can think of them as categories. Eg:</p>

<ul>
  <li>classify the spam emails</li>
  <li>determine whether a person has diabetes</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, the result of regression problem can be used to solve a classification problem. Eg, given the predicted price of the house, whether one could sell it successfully. Thatâ€™s also known as <strong>Logistic Regression</strong></p>

<h3 id="more-on-unsupervised-learning">More on unsupervised-learning</h3>

<p>In unsupervised-learning, only a set of inputs are given. There is no output.
The goal is usually finding clusters or groups that are closely related given certain inputs. Eg:</p>

<ul>
  <li>given 10000 articles, put them into groups with similar topics</li>
</ul>
